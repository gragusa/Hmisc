\title{Merge Multiple Data Frames or Data Tables}
\usage{
Merge(..., id, all = TRUE, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{a formula containing all the identification variables such that the combination of these variables uniquely identifies subjects or records of interest.  May be omitted for data tables; in that case the \code{key} function retrieves the id variables.}

\item{all}{set to \code{FALSE} to drop observations not found in second and later data frames (only applies if not using \code{data.table})}

\item{verbose}{set to \code{FALSE} to not print information about observations}

\item{\dots}{two or more dataframes or data tables}
}
\description{
Merges an arbitrarily large series of data frames or data tables containing common \code{id} variables (keys for data tables).  Information about number of observations and number of unique \code{id}s in individual and final merged datasets is printed.  The first data frame has special meaning in that all of its observations are kept whether they match \code{id}s in other data frames or not.  For all other data frames, by default non-matching observations are dropped.  The first data frame is also the one against which counts of unique \code{id}s are compared.  Sometimes \code{merge} drops variable attributes such as \code{labels} and \code{units}.  These are restored by \code{Merge}.  If all objects are of class \code{data.table}, faster merging will be done using the \code{data.table} package's join operation.  This assumes that all objects have identical key variables and those of the variables on which to merge.

b <- data.frame(sid=c(1,2,2), bp=c(120,130,140))
d <- data.frame(sid=c(1,3,4), wt=c(170,180,190))

\dontrun{
# For data.table, first file must be the master file and must
# contain all ids that ever occur.  ids not in the master will
# not be merged from other datasets.
require(data.table)
a <- data.table(a); setkey(a, sid)
# data.table also does not allow duplicates without allow.cartesian=TRUE
b <- data.table(sid=1:2, bp=c(120,130)); setkey(b, sid)
d <- data.table(d); setkey(d, sid)
